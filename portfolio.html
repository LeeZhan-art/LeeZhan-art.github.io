    <h3>This is the result of me and my team working on PLTW 1.1 for around 2-3 weeks. We intergrated all that we learned into this one project and this was the final result. Where we made an
      image within and image withing an image. Then we shifted those images so that it looked like the images would teleport from one coordinate to another. This was the best idea we could think 
      of as we tryed puting most of the things we learned in this activity.

      After we worked through 1.2 problems, me and my team again put everything we knew into one project. This time we decided to make the famous Snake game, where you eat an apple and get an 
      increase in the body length. We made the snake head a circle, and the food a triangle. Each time the snake head is within a distance of 20, the segements increase (so we appeneded a circle 
      each time food was touched). Also making food worth 10 points each, and setting score = 0 and high_score = 0, and rewriting high_score to score if score > high_score.
